                    <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>designated home page</strong> is often the <strong>index</strong> file. This is the
                        default file that is served when a user requests the root directory of a website, and it usually
                        contains the main content of the website. The name of the designated home page varies depending
                        on the server and language used. For example, <strong>index.html</strong> or
                        <strong>index.php</strong> is often the designate homepage in Apache servers.
                    </p>
                    <p>The browser's Web Dev/Inspector Network tab displays the files that are being requested and
                        loaded by the browser. These files are known as <strong>resources</strong>. Network tab displays
                        the <strong>age</strong> of the file, its <strong>cache details</strong>, server
                        <strong>date</strong>, <strong>last-modified</strong> date, <strong>server type</strong>, and
                        <strong>code</strong> read by the server.
                    </p>
                    <p>The file details are different when viewed from the web server because the file details may
                        include additional information such as the <strong>status</strong> of the file, <strong>HTTP
                            headers</strong>, <strong>server configurations</strong>, and <strong>permissions</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>The favicon.ico file has a status <strong>200</strong> because the file was <strong>successfully
                            found</strong> and loaded by the browser. The main.css and main.js files have a status
                        <strong>400</strong> because the files are <strong>not found</strong> and cannot be loaded by
                        the browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <strong>scheme</strong> is the protocol that is used to communicate with the client. The
                        <strong>subdomains</strong> are the subdomains of the host domain. The <strong>host
                            domain</strong> is the domain of the web server. The <strong>resources</strong> are the
                        resources that are being loaded by the browser. The parts of the web server's
                        <strong>URL</strong> are as follows, the <strong>scheme:</strong> https://, the
                        <strong>subdomains:</strong> web.engr., the <strong>domain:</strong> oregonstate.edu, and the
                        <strong>resources:</strong> /~higgirac/a1-higgirac/ .

                        <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                        <p><strong>Frontend Design</strong> is the process of creating the <strong>user
                                interface</strong> and <strong>user experience</strong> of a website or web application.
                            This involves using technologies such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
                            <strong>JavaScript</strong> to build the visual and structural elements of a web page. HTML
                            (HyperText Markup Language) is used to define the structure, including paragraphs, headings,
                            links, and images among other content elements. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is applied to
                            HTML for stylistic decision making in regards to these elements. Finally, JavaScript is used
                            to create web pages' dynamic behavior. Frontend design also involves
                            <strong>usability</strong> and <strong>inclusivity</strong> considerations in the design and
                            engineering process. These concepts when applied in frontend design work together to build
                            interfaces that are visually appealing, and user-friendly.

                        <p>The <strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong> tag is used to define the introductory section of a
                            webpage which typically includes the name, publisher, and marketing slogan. The
                            <strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong> tag is used to define the main content area. The
                            <strong>&lt;nav&gt;</strong> tag is used to define a section of navigation links allowing
                            users to navigate to different pages or sections within a website. Main menu, search, tools,
                            stories, locations, and legal links are typically included in sets of navigation. The
                            <strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong> tag is used to divide a webpage into content blocks. It
                            organizes related, but not standalone, content into meaningful portions. The
                            <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong> tag defines standalone content which can can be distributed
                            and reused independently. The <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> tag defines the bottom section
                            of a webpage which often contains copyright information, contact information, and links to
                            critical pages.

                            <li><strong>Linking to External Content</strong> allows for easy navigation to external
                                content. This requires the <strong>Anchor</strong> element <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> to
                                create a <strong>hyperlink</strong> that specifies the <strong>URL</strong> of the
                                external website using the <strong>href</strong> attribute. For example, &lt;a
                                href=“https://example.com"&gt;External Link&lt;/a&gt;.</li>
                            <li><strong>Linking to Internal Content</strong> is the act of linking to internal content
                                within the same webpage by using Anchor tags with href attributes pointing to
                                <strong>IDs</strong> which define the reference for an anchor. For example, the id:
                                "&lt;article id=“Introduction”&gt;The content for this section…&lt;/article&gt;", and
                                the anchor: &lt;a href=“#Introduction”&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Linking Page-to-Page Content</strong> is the creation of links to other webpages
                                within the same website, creating <strong>page-to-page navigation</strong>. This is
                                accomplished by specifying the <strong>relative</strong> (for internal resources) or
                                <strong>absolute</strong> (for external resources) URL of the target page in the href
                                attribute. For example, &lt;a href=“../images/logos.png”&gt;Image logo&lt;/a&gt;, or
                                &lt;a href=“https://example.com/app/images/logos.png"&gt;Image logo&lt;/a&gt;.

                            <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>
                            <p>There are six major specifications for optimizing images:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Descriptive File Name:</strong> Enhances search engine optimization (SEO) by
                                    making the image content clear and searchable. Using specific descriptors helps
                                    search engines categorize and display the image appropriately in search results.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Small File Size:</strong> Improves website loading times by reducing the
                                    amount of data transferred when a page is accessed. This is achieved through
                                    compression techniques, which can either be lossy (reducing quality) or lossless
                                    (maintaining quality).</li>
                                <li><strong>Exact Dimensions:</strong> Ensures that images fit precisely within the
                                    designated space on a webpage without needing to be resized by the browser, which
                                    can slow down page load times and degrade image quality.</li>
                                <li><strong>Correct File Format:</strong> Selecting the right file format (e.g., JPG,
                                    PNG, GIF) based on the nature of the image and its use on the web optimizes the
                                    balance between quality and file size. Different formats are suited for different
                                    types of images and uses.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reduced Resolution:</strong> Matches the image resolution to the
                                    capabilities of most viewing devices, which is typically lower than the resolution
                                    used for printing. This avoids unnecessary high resolution that can increase file
                                    size without a visible improvement in quality on standard displays.</li>
                                <li><strong>Color Mode:</strong> Chooses the appropriate color mode (RGB or Indexed) for
                                    the image based on how it will be displayed. RGB is used for most images due to its
                                    broad color range, while Indexed is useful for simpler images to reduce file size.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Different image file formats are optimized for specific types of content due to their
                                unique compression methods and color support. <strong>Photos</strong>, which usually
                                contain complex color gradients and details, are best served by the <strong>JPEG
                                    (JPG)</strong> format. JPEG offers a good balance between quality and file size
                                through adjustable compression that reduces file size while maintaining accuracy. For
                                <strong>line art</strong>, such as logos or simple graphics with fewer colors, the
                                <strong>GIF</strong> format is suitable because it supports a limited color palette (up
                                to 256 colors), which helps keep the file size small. Additionally, <strong>PNG</strong>
                                can be a good choice for line art that requires high clarity with support for
                                transparency and lossless compression, preserving the sharpness of edges without
                                degradation over multiple edits.
                            </p>
                            <p>Browsers and devices utilize <strong>Favicons</strong> to improve user navigation and
                                strengthen brand identity across various interfaces. These small icons appear in browser
                                tabs, assisting users in quickly identifying and switching between sites. Favicons are
                                also used in bookmarks and browser history, offering a visual sign that makes specific
                                pages easier to find. Furthermore, when websites are saved to a smartphone’s home screen
                                or as app shortcuts, favicons serve as the application icons, enhancing recognition.
                                Some search engines display favicons in search results, further aiding brand visibility
                                and user orientation. </p>

                                <h3>Cacading Stylesheets</h3>
                                <p>Stylesheets, typically <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong>, are essential
                                    for websites and apps because they enable developers to separate content from
                                    design, allowing for more efficient and flexible styling across multiple web pages.
                                    This separation simplifies maintaining and updating the visual appearance of a site
                                    or app. Stylesheets enhance user experience by providing consistent theming and
                                    responsive design, ensuring that websites and apps look good on various devices and
                                    screen sizes. Additionally, CSS can improve load times and performance by reducing
                                    the need for inline styling and repetitive code.</p>
                                <p>Incorporating styles in web development can be achieved through five main methods,
                                    each offering unique advantages. <strong>External stylesheets</strong> are used
                                    widely for their efficiency in applying consistent styles across multiple pages via
                                    a single CSS file, making maintenance and updates easier. <strong>Imported
                                        CSS</strong> in a global stylesheet allows modular management of styles but can
                                    increase load times due to additional HTTP requests. <strong>Embedded CSS</strong>
                                    within an HTML file using the <strong>&lt;style&gt;</strong> tag is useful for
                                    page-specific styles, simplifying deployment without affecting other pages.
                                    <strong>Inline styles</strong> applied directly to HTML elements with the style
                                    attribute are good for quick, one-off modifications, although they hinder style
                                    reusability and clutter HTML. Lastly, <strong>JavaScript-based styling</strong>
                                    manipulates styles dynamically which is ideal for interactive and condition-based
                                    styling, enhancing user experiences by adapting to runtime conditions.

                                    <h3>Forms</h3>
                                    <p>The six primary goals of accessible forms:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Provide clear instructions:</strong> Clear instructions above the
                                            form and in the labels helps users understand how to interact with the form
                                            and provide the required information accurately.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Inform users about data collection and required fields:</strong>
                                            Clear communication about why certain data is being collected and which
                                            fields are mandatory helps users understand the form's purpose and
                                            requirements.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Set the first field to autofocus:</strong> Autofocusing the first
                                            field allows users to start typing immediately without manually selecting
                                            the input field, enhancing usability and efficiency.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Accessible via keyboard:</strong> Keyboard accessibility ensures
                                            that users who cannot or prefer not to use a mouse can navigate and interact
                                            with every form effectively.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Tab indexing to complex forms:</strong> Tab indexing specifies the
                                            order in which form fields are navigated when using the tab key, improving
                                            the logical flow and usability of complex forms.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Ensure validation messages are screen-readable:</strong>
                                            Screen-readable validation messages ensure that users, including those using
                                            screen readers, receive clear and understandable feedback about errors or
                                            validation issues with their form submissions.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Major HTML tags used in forms:</p>
                                    <ul>

                                            type of input), "name" (defines the name of the input field), and "required"
                                            (indicates if the field is mandatory).</li>
                                        <li><strong>&lt;select&gt;</strong>: Creates a dropdown list of options.
                                            Contains one or more <strong>&lt;option&gt;</strong> tags for specifying the
                                            available choices. Attributes include name (defines the name of the select
                                            field) and "multiple" (allows multiple selections if present).</li>
                                        <li><strong>&lt;textarea&gt;</strong>: Defines a multiline text input control.
                                            Attributes include "name" (defines the name of the textarea field) and
                                            "rows"/"cols" (specifies the visible number of rows/columns).</li>
                                        <li><strong>&lt;button&gt;</strong>: Defines a clickable button often used for
                                            form submission. It can have attributes like "type" (specifies the type of
                                            button, e.g., "submit" or "reset") and "disabled" (turns off the button).

                                        <h3>Node / Express</h3>
                                        <p><strong>Node.js, npm, and Express.js</strong> are essential technologies in
                                            modern web development.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Node.js</strong> is a runtime environment that allows developers to
                                            run JavaScript code outside a web browser and use JavaScript on the client
                                            and server sides, allowing full-stack JavaScript development. Due to its
                                            non-blocking and event-driven architecture, Node.js is highly scalable and
                                            capable of efficiently handling many concurrent connections. Node.js offers
                                            developers the ability to build scalable and high-performance applications
                                            efficiently.</p>
                                        <p><strong>npm (Node Package Manager)</strong> is the default package manager
                                            for Node.js. It installs, manages, and shares packages of JavaScript code.
                                            npm provides access to an extensive ecosystem of open-source libraries and
                                            tools that can be easily integrated into Node.js projects. npm simplifies
                                            dependency management and allows developers to leverage existing solutions
                                            to accelerate development.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Express.js</strong> is a web application framework for Node.js
                                            designed to build web applications and APIs. It provides robust features for
                                            handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, middleware integration,
                                            templating engines, and more. Express.js follows the middleware pattern,
                                            allowing developers to combine modular components to create powerful and
                                            flexible applications.</p>
                                        <p>These three technologies improve modern web development, allowing developers
                                            to build efficient, scalable, and flexible web applications and APIs.</p>

                                            <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> has several fundamental <strong>data
                                                    types</strong> that are used to manipulate
                                                <strong>variables</strong> and store <strong>values</strong>. These
                                                include <strong>primitive data types</strong> like
                                                <strong>strings</strong>, <strong>numbers</strong>,
                                                <strong>symbols</strong>, and <strong>booleans</strong>, representing
                                                textual data, numerical data, unique identifiers, and true/false values.
                                                A <strong>Symbol</strong> is a unique and immutable data type
                                                introduced in ES6 to create unique identifiers for object properties.
                                                Its uniqueness makes symbols ideal for defining object properties that
                                                must be private or protected from accidental changes or collisions in
                                                large codebases. There are also <strong>null</strong> and
                                                <strong>undefined</strong>, which signify the absence of a meaningful
                                                value and an uninitialized state. JavaScript also supports complex data
                                                types like objects, which are collections of properties mapped by
                                                strings or symbols and can contain various data types.
                                                <strong>Objects</strong> serve as a fundamental building block in
                                                JavaScript and can be used to create more complex structures like
                                                arrays, functions, and more. A <strong>Function</strong> is another
                                                complex data type. Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a
                                                particular task or calculate values and can be invoked throughout the
                                                program.
                                            </p>
                                            <p><strong>Objects</strong> in JavaScript are used to store keyed
                                                collections of various data and more complex entities. An object is
                                                created by listing <strong>properties</strong> inside curly braces
                                                <strong>{}</strong>, with each property being a <strong>key-value
                                                    pair</strong>. <strong>Arrays</strong> are unique kinds of objects
                                                used for storing ordered collections of items, accessible by
                                                <strong>indices</strong>. <strong>JSON (JavaScript Object
                                                    Notation)</strong> is a lightweight data-interchange format that
                                                uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting
                                                of <strong>attribute-value pairs</strong>. It is heavily used for data
                                                exchange between a server and web applications.
                                            </p>
                                            <p><strong>Conditionals</strong> and <strong>Loops</strong> are used in
                                                JavaScript to control the flow of execution based on
                                                different conditions and to perform repetitive tasks, respectively.
                                                Conditionals like <strong>if</strong>, <strong>else</strong>, and
                                                <strong>switch</strong> allow the code to execute different blocks based
                                                on various conditions. Loops, such as <strong>for</strong>,
                                                <strong>while</strong>, and <strong>do-while</strong>, enable executing
                                                a code block multiple times until a specified condition fails. These
                                                structures are fundamental for creating dynamic behavior in
                                                applications.

                                                paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in
                                                the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code,
                                                in the form of functions (often known as methods). In JavaScript, OOP is
                                                implemented using <strong>prototypes</strong> and
                                                <strong>classes</strong>. Classes provide a more straightforward and
                                                cleaner way to create objects and deal with inheritance, allowing more
                                                complex and modular software development.

                                            <p><strong>Functional programming</strong> is a programming paradigm where
                                                programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. Functional
                                                programming is declarative and avoids shared state, mutable data, and
                                                side effects. JavaScript supports functional programming by treating
                                                functions as having special privileges, meaning that functions can be
                                                assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other
                                                functions, enabling a flexible approach to software construction.</p>
